						In 1988, Global Polio Eradication Initiative was lunched. Since then, immunisation efforts have reduced the number of polio cases globally by more than 99 percent, saving more than 10 million children from paralysis.
						Polio remains endemic in just three countries - <span class="polio-location">Nigeria</span>, <span class="polio-location">Pakistan</span>, and <span class="polio-location">Afghanistan</span>.
					</p>
					<h3 class="bg-title blue">Polio and Global Polio Eradication Initiative</h3>
					<p class="bg-describe">
						Polio is a highly infectious disease with no cure. It mainly affects children who are younger than five years old. The virus of polio can cause paralysis by destroying the nervous system.
						The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) was launched in 1988, by WHO, Rotary International, CDC and UNICEF. By immunising children with effective vaccines, more than 99 percent of polio cases have been reduced by the immunisation; more than 10 million children have been saved from being paralysed.
					</p>
					<h3 class="bg-title blue">What are we doing?</h3>
					<p class="bg-describe">
						Today, polio remains endemic in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. To eradicate polio worldwide, UNICEF is building Rhizome, a real-time data platform to be used by GPEI employees from all levels.
						Rhizome platform collects data from lowest possible level by allowing users to enter data via web form. After data has been aggregated, Rhizome platform can visualise the data for district, country and leadership level managers. With Rhizome, UNICEF have more comprehensive access to immunisation campaign related data. Rhizome is also a open source software. The future version of Rhizome will be suitable for any other similar data.
					</p>
					<p class="bg-describe bg-title-polio">
						"ThoughtWorks is helping UNICEF build, test and roll out the Rhizome platform."

						Will add some message in here.
